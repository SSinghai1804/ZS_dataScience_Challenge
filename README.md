# ZS_dataScience_Challenge
This repo contains my code for the ZS data Science Challenge conducted from 20/07/18 to 23/07/18 on Hackerearth
This is the first time I have attended an online challenge. I was able to score 1.65 out of 2 and scored a descent rank of 340 out of the 6k people registered.
This was an awesome experience and I learnt a lot especially dataframe manipulation. I will continue to take part in such challenges.
And sorry for not providing any documentation. I'll do that when I have some free time.
